I developed this project as my first step into backend development using Node.js. The application was built exclusively with plain Node.js, without the use of any additional frameworks such as Express.js. Thanks to the wonderful instructor Jonas Schmedtmann, I was able to complete this project as part of my journey in this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/).
